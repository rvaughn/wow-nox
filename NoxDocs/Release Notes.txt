Nox Information Bar Release Notes
=================================

===========================================================================
Version 2.0 by Gruma on 2005/06/26
    - Reworked the rendering core to allow options for variables. This adds a huge amount of configurability.
    - Made the tooltip configurable using the same variables as the bar itself. Unfortunately this means that tooltip lines will no longer hide themselves for level 60 chars.
    - Revised the time to level estimates so that they return "n/a" for level 60 chars.
    - Added many variables, added options to many others, and deprecated a few that are now redundant. See the documentation for specifics.
    - Expanded the number of available slots to 16.
    - Combined the NoxMoveBuffs and NoxMoveBGFlag extensions into a single NoxMover extension.
    - Added the ability to move the minimap, target frame, and player frame to the NoxMover.
    - Moved the variables handled by NoxSampleExtension into a new "real" extension - NoxPlayerStats. NoxSampleExtension now handles only junk variables.
    - Added the NoxEquipmentStats extension to add inventory and durability variables to the bar.
    - Added the NoxSkillStats extension to add skills variables to the bar.
    - Rewrote the documentation. It should be much more complete now.
    - Revised the config GUI to handle the additional slots, tooltip configuration, and mover configuration.
===========================================================================
Version 1.8.4 by Gruma on 2005/06/13
    - Fixed NoxMoveBuffs so that it will correctly use the offsets configured
      in SavedVariables.
    - Added NoxMoveBGFlag to move the "capture the flag" icon down a few pixels.
===========================================================================
Version 1.8.3 by Gruma on 2005/06/10
    - Added a missing "round" function to fix problems with NoxMoveBuffs
      and two of the memory variables.
    - Improved the way "time played" messages are blocked from showing in
      chat.
    - Made NoxMoveBuffs save its offsets, for primitive configurability.
===========================================================================
Version 1.8.2 by Gruma on 2005/06/07
    - Updated for interface version 1500 (client patch 1.5.0).
===========================================================================
Version 1.8.1 by Gruma on 2005/06/06
    - Corrected a minor issue with the German translation that prevented
      the tooltip from working with that client.
===========================================================================
Version 1.8 by Gruma on 2005/06/04
    - Added a configuration GUI.  This can be invoked by the right-clicking
      this bar, through myAddOns, or by the command "/noxib config".
    - Removed the slash command for colors, as this was never implemented.
      Colors can be configured through the new GUI.
    - Added usage summaries for all slash commands.
    - Added compatibility with MyAddOns.
    - Moved combat stats to a separate bundled addon, NoxCombatStats.
    - Added honor stats via a separate bundled addon, NoxHonorStats.
      These are:
            
            {lifetimeHK}       -> Number of honorable kills over lifetime.
            {lifetimeDK}       -> Number of dishonorable kills over lifetime.
            {lifetimeRank}     -> Highest rank achieved over lifetime.
            {lastweekHK}       -> Number of honorable kills earned last week.
            {lastweekDK}       -> Number of dishonorable kills earned last week.
            {lastweekCP}       -> Number of contribution points earned last week.
            {lastweekStanding} -> Numeric standing achieved last week.
            {yesterdayHK}      -> Number of honorable kills earned yesterday.
            {yesterdayDK}      -> Number of dishonorable kills earned yesterday.
            {yesterdayCP}      -> Number of contribution points earned yesterday.
            {sessionHK}        -> Number of honorable kills earned this session.
            {sessionDK}        -> Number of dishonorable kills earned this session.
            {currentRank}      -> Player's current rank.
            {currentStanding}  -> Player's current numeric standing.

    - Added two new parameters in the core addon:

            {memlimitkb}       -> UI memory GC threshold, in kilobytes.
            {memlimitmb}       -> UI memory GC threshold, in megabytes.

      Note that this isn't the total amount of memory available, but is
      instead the amount of memory that must be used before the UI runs the
      next garbage collection cycle.
    - Reworked the tooltip to add more experience info and hopefully make it
      easier to read overall.
    - Made the experience bars configurable, both for visibility and color.
    - Modified the tooltip and experience bars to hide experience stats
      for level 60 characters.
    - Added a tiny bundled addon to move the buff icons down a few pixels.
      This might be useful to players who use a wide Nox bar at the top
      of their screens.  This addon is not configurable at the moment (but
      you can easily edit the offsets in the code).
    - Changed the "reset" slash command to reset the session instead of
      restoring defaults.  Defaults are available via a button in the config
      panel.
    - Broke most of the remaining localization.  There wasn't much lost as
      the German translation was only partially done and the French
      translation was never done anyway.  We would welcome volunteers to
      do these translations for us.
===========================================================================
Version 1.7 by Gruma on 2005/04/27
    - Tweaked a few cosmetic issues to hopefully make the bar slightly
      more attractive.
    - Fixed the {hours} display so that noon and midnight show as "12"
      rather than 0.
    - Fixed the handling of rested experience so that the experience
      bars display correctly now.
    - Made the clock offset settings configurable per-character.  This
      was needed since different realms are on different time standards.
      Unfortunately there is no "default" at this time - you have to
      configure each character separately, but only for the clock offset.
    - Changed all bag slot calculations to ignore ammo bags.
    - Fixed a problem with the text from slots still being displayed
      after a slot is hidden.
    - Fixed some minor memory allocation issues.
    - Added new variables:

            {memmb}            -> UI memory used in megabytes.
            {memkb}            -> UI memory used in kilobytes.
            {xptolevel%}       -> Percentage XP needed to level.
            {restbonus}        -> Amount of additional experience that 
                                  will be counted as "rested".
            {restlimit}        -> Total amount of experience needed
                                  before the "rested" bonus is used up.
            {ammo}             -> Total amount of equipped ammo.
            {sessionttl}       -> Estimated time to level for this session,
                                  in "0d 0h 0m 0s" format.
            {sessionttlshort}  -> Estimated time to level for this session,
                                  in "d.h:m:s" format.
            {levelttl}         -> Estimated time to level for this level,
                                  in "0d 0h 0m 0s" format.
            {levelttlshort}    -> Estimated time to level for this level,
                                  in "d.h:m:s" format.
            {bestttl}          -> Smallest of session TTL and level TTL,
                                  in "0d 0h 0m 0s" format.
            {bestttlshort}     -> Smallest of session TTL and level TTL,
                                  in "d.h:m:s" format.
            {allmoney}         -> Money displayed in "0g 0s 0c" format.

    - The rested numbers need a little explanation.  {rest} returns
      the amount of extra bonus experience the game gives you for being
      rested.  This is half of {restbonus} which is the raw number the
      game reports.  {restlimit} is the total amount of experience that
      can be gained before the rested bonus expires, and is the same as 
      {xp} + {restbonus}.
    - Reworked the code enough to allow extensions, and added a sample
      extension with a handful of new (probably useless) parameters:

            {name}             -> Current player's name.
            {class}            -> Current player's class.
            {realm}            -> Current player's realm.
            {zone}             -> Current zone the player is in.
            {shortzone}        -> The zone name in the minimap.  Seems to
                                  be the same thing as subzone.
            {subzone}          -> Current subzone the player is in.

    - Added an "advanced" extension that adds a coin display to the bar.
      This is enabled by using the "{coins}" variable in the display
      string.
===========================================================================
Version 1.6 by ins0mniaque on 2005/04/04

      don't have the time to test this out.
===========================================================================
Version 1.5 by ins0mniaque on 2005/04/03
    - Fixed German (and other languages) translation for plural based on
      code by Starmaster. Danke!
    - *SHOULD* have fixed most maths errors. I currently do not have time
      to test it, so I used my "instinct" to correct the bugs.
===========================================================================
Version 1.4 by ins0mniaque on 2005/04/01
    - Added German translation provided by Wolfgang Stöckle. Danke schön!

    - Still an alpha release...
    - Fixed path in zip file.
    - Fixed bug when player had no rest XP.
    - Fixed bug that made it crash on load when language was not english.
      (Should work with french and german versions right now, but it is
      not translated, and I doubt that the dps calculator will work in
      those languages...)
    - Added clock and tooltip parameters...
    
      New slash commands:
      
      /noxib tooltip [state=<'on', 'off'>] 
                     [position=<'anchor'>]
                     [x=number]
                     [y=number]
                     
      List of anchor values:
        - 'left'
        - 'topleft'
        - 'top'
        - 'topright'
        - 'right'
        - 'bottomright'
        - 'bottom'
        - 'bottomleft'
                    
      e.g. Putting the tooltip in the bottom right corner...
           /noxib tooltip position='bottomright' x=-32 y=32
           
           Shutting off the tooltip
           /noxib tooltip state='off'
           
      
      /noxib clock [offsethour=number] [offsetminute=number]
      
      e.g. Resetting the offsets to zero
           /noxib clock
           
           Putting an offset of minus 2 hours and 30 minutes
           /noxib clock offsethour=-2 offsetminute=-30
           
           
    - A complete help file is still in progress.
    - The color parameters are still not implemented yet...

            |r                 -> Restore previous color
            
            e.g. '|cffff0000{dps}|r dps' will display the current dps in
                 opaque red (ff, ff, 00, 00), and then " dps" in the 
                 default color (which is a nearly pure yellow).
                 
      Quick exemples:
        
        Display only clock (in white) in a 100 pixel large bar:
        
          /noxib hide slot=1-9           -> Hide all slots
          /noxib show slot=1             -> Show slot 1
          /noxib resize slot=1 width=100 -> Resize slot 1 to 100 pixels
          /noxib remap slot=1 display='|cffffffff{24hours}:{minutes}'
          
          
    - A complete help file in progress.
