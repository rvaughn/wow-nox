2010-12-05 version 4.0.3b1
        
    * Fixed the coins display to initialize correctly at login.

    * Fixed combat stats so they don't constantly throw an error.

    * Completely removed the {ammo} parameter.
        
    * Raised the level cap to 85.

    - Combat stats have not been verified working yet, they just
      don't throw the Lua error anymore.

    - The documentation needs updating.

    - There is still a startup problem where the bar sometimes shows
      up with default settings, rather than the configured settings.
      Enter "/console reloadui" in chat to reload it (and everything
      else too).
        
    - The NoxMover still throws errors.

2010-11-11 version 4.0.0b2
        
    * Fixes support for professions. All other skill stats are either
      removed from the game or unsupported right now. Also adds the
      new {skill title:} parameter that returns the name of your
      current profession rank. (eg. "Journeyman", "Expert", etc.)

2010-10-18 version 4.0.0a1
        
    * Alpha version - includes basic fixes for 4.0. Work in progress.
